# First-step-code
Hi there!
New to coding, I’m currently practicing with C#.
I hope that over time, I’ll be able to earn my certification from 42 School and land a job in C# development—ideally in Switzerland, or even better, in the USA.
For now, I’m training and building small beginner projects, aiming to complete a more advanced one in the future.
You can follow my coding progress on my GitHub.
Thanks for taking the time to read!

Best regards,
